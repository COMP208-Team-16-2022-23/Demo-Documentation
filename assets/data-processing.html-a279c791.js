In statistics, an outlier is a data point that significantly differs from other observations, and may be caused by experimental error or other factors. Outliers can cause serious problems in statistical analysis and can affect the accuracy and reliability of results. Therefore, outlier handling algorithms are essential for identifying and dealing with these problematic data points. These algorithms can help improve the quality of the dataset and ultimately lead to more accurate and reliable analysis results.</p><p>Outlier handling algorithms can use various methods for identification and management, including statistical-based, machine learning-based, and deep learning-based approaches. Common statistical-based methods include the 3σ rule, box plot method, etc. Machine learning-based methods include Local Outlier Factor (LOF), Isolation Forest, etc., while deep learning-based methods include Autoencoder, etc.</p><p>When dealing with outliers, it is necessary to choose the appropriate algorithm based on the specific scenario. Sometimes, certain outliers may contain useful information, and therefore require careful consideration and management. In general, through appropriate outlier handling algorithms, the quality of the dataset can be improved, and the accuracy of the results can be enhanced.</p>',17),N={href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlier",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},O=e("h4",{id:"parameters",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#parameters","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),a(" Parameters")],-1),C=e("code",null,"Detection method",-1),E={href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/68%E2%80%9395%E2%80%9399.7_rule",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},M={href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},W={href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_absolute_deviation",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},F=e("li",null,[e("code",null,"Processing method"),a(": Outlier processing method.
