A drop-down option it has will display the datasets you currently have, including those you have uploaded and those generated by processing tasks.</p></li><li><p>Column Selection Node</p><p>The Column Selection Node is used to select columns from a dataset. When the Column Selection Node is correctly activated in the node editor, a line of text will appear between the input and output interfaces, showing all the columns in the received dataset. The input field below the display row is used to select the columns you want to output for processing, and column names are separated by commas.</p></li></ul><h3 id="output-nodes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#output-nodes" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Output Nodes</h3><p>An output node is a node that only has an input interface but no output interface. In the node editor, a process <strong>must</strong> contain <strong>at least one</strong> output node to activate the process. Otherwise, <strong>any</strong> calculations or operations in the flow will not be effective.</p><ul><li><p>End Node</p><p>The End Node is the most basic output node, it is also the most recommended one. It does not have any output display, but only marks the end of a branch in the process.</p></li><li><p>Display Node</p><p>By connecting a node to the Display Node on the basis of the End Node, the output of the current node can be displayed. The storage structure of most node output files in the editor can be used to check whether a branch in the process has run successfully. However, it is not recommended to use only the Display Node without the End Node.</p></li></ul><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">TIP</p><p>We do not recommend using Display Node alone because its display is not synchronous. If you use Display Node instead of End Node alone, but do not see any display content after connection, it does not necessarily mean that the operation in the current process or branch has failed. If you have done the above operation, you need to create a new node in the node editor to refresh the display.</p></div><h3 id="processing-nodes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#processing-nodes" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Processing Nodes</h3><p>The current Node Editor contains 7 processing nodes, which have the same processing methods as those in Data Processing, and each node is named after a data processing method.
