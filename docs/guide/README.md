## Introduction

Low-Code Data Analysis (LCDA) is a tool designed to simplify data analysis by minimizing programming requirements. With
LCDA, users can analyze large data sets quickly and easily, without the need for writing complex code. The platform
features a user-friendly interface that enables users to drag and drop data into the analysis and visualization results,
making it an ideal tool for beginners in artificial intelligence, data scientists, business analysts, and anyone seeking
to derive insights from data.

The LCDA platform was developed with the aim of addressing the challenges faced by beginners when dealing with the
complicated terminologies associated with artificial intelligence. The LCDA team, comprised of members who took
an [introductory course in Artificial Intelligence]([Module Catalogues](http://modules.xjtlu.edu.cn/?mod_code=INT104))
during their undergraduate Year 1 studies, understands the difficulty of learning AI from scratch. To make the process
less intimidating for beginners, the team decided to create a website that allows users to explore the world of AI
without having to install any software. Currently, the platform is in the demo stage and is continuously being improved
to provide a better user experience.

## How It Works

LCDA is a Python-based web application that is built using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/), making
it easily accessible to users through their web browser. Python was chosen as the programming language for this project
due to its extensive library of artificial intelligence and data science related packages. This allowed the team to
efficiently achieve the project's goals within a limited development timeline.

To ensure that users can access the LCDA platform with ease, the team has implemented various security measures. The
platform uses SSL encryption to secure user data during transmission and uses a secure login process to prevent
unauthorized access. Additionally, the platform is regularly updated with the latest security patches to ensure that
users are protected against any potential vulnerabilities.

## Why Not ...?

### SPSS Statistics

[SPSS](https://www.ibm.com/products/spss-statistics) is a widely used data analysis software with an excellent set of products. While SPSS can perform far more
specialized functions than LCDA, it requires a fee for usage, and its interface can be complex, making it challenging
for beginners to use. In contrast, LCDA prioritizes user-friendly design and intuitive functionality, making it easy for
beginners to get started with data analysis.

### Python

Python is a popular programming language for artificial intelligence and data science, and its open-source nature makes
it easily accessible. However, for beginners who are unfamiliar with programming, installing and using a large number of
Python AI-related packages can be overwhelming, let alone mastering the use of functions in the library. LCDA is a
Python-based web application that simplifies data analysis by packaging common data analysis algorithms, providing
visualization tools, and offering user-friendly result pages. This reduces the cost of trial and error for beginners and
enables them to learn new concepts through exploration.

Compared to SPSS and Python, LCDA offers an easy-to-use platform that combines the benefits of both. It provides a
low-code solution that simplifies data analysis without sacrificing functionality, making it an ideal choice for
beginners, data scientists, business analysts, and anyone looking to derive insights from data with ease.
