# Data Processing

Data processing is a crucial step in analyzing experimental data using LCDA. Data collected from experiments may contain
various issues, such as noise, skewness, and outliers, which may affect the accuracy and reliability of the results.
Therefore, it is important to process the data before analysis.

This chapter will guide you through the steps of data processing. Whether you are a novice or an experienced user, this
chapter provides valuable information and guidance to help you obtain accurate and reliable results using LCDA.

## Data Processing Projects

### Create a new project

Before beginning data processing in LCDA, you will need to create a new data processing project. This can be done by
clicking on the `NEW PROCESSING` button located in the upper right corner of the `Data Processing` interface.

## Data Processing Algorithms

### Outlier handling

#### Description

Outlier handling algorithms are used to identify and handle outliers in a dataset. In statistics, an outlier is a data
point that significantly differs from other observations, and may be caused by experimental error or other factors.
Outliers can cause serious problems in statistical analysis and can affect the accuracy and reliability of results.
Therefore, outlier handling algorithms are essential for identifying and dealing with these problematic data points.
These algorithms can help improve the quality of the dataset and ultimately lead to more accurate and reliable analysis
results.

Outlier handling algorithms can use various methods for identification and management, including statistical-based, 
machine learning-based, and deep learning-based approaches. Common statistical-based methods include the 3Ïƒ rule, box 
plot method, etc. Machine learning-based methods include Local Outlier Factor (LOF), Isolation Forest, etc., while deep 
learning-based methods include Autoencoder, etc.

When dealing with outliers, it is necessary to choose the appropriate algorithm based on the specific scenario. 
Sometimes, certain outliers may contain useful information, and therefore require careful consideration and management. 
In general, through appropriate outlier handling algorithms, the quality of the dataset can be improved, and the 
accuracy of the results can be enhanced.

### Missing value handling

#### Description

Missing value processing refers to the process of handling missing values in a dataset. In data analysis and machine 
learning tasks, missing values are a common problem. The existence of missing values may be due to errors in the data 
collection process, human omissions, or other factors. If missing values are not handled, they will affect the accuracy 
and reliability of data analysis and machine learning models.

Methods for missing value processing include deletion, imputation, and prediction. Deletion refers to directly deleting 
data rows or columns that contain missing values. This method may reduce the amount of data but may make the dataset 
incomplete and lose useful information. Imputation refers to using existing data to infer missing values. Imputation 
methods include mean imputation, median imputation, regression imputation, and interpolation. Prediction refers to using
machine learning models to predict missing values. This method requires training machine learning models with existing 
data and then using the models to predict missing values.

When choosing a missing value processing method, factors to consider include the nature of the data, the cause of data 
missing, and the bias that processing methods may introduce. Through appropriate missing value processing methods, the 
accuracy and reliability of data analysis and machine learning models can be improved.

### Tail shrinkage and truncation processing

#### Description

When there is sufficient sample data, it is common to perform shrinkage or truncation on continuous variables to eliminate
the influence of extreme values on research. The purpose of shrinkage or truncation is to make the extreme values in the 
dataset closer to the central value, thereby making the dataset more consistent with the normal distribution. The data 
values that fall outside of a specific percentile range for the variable are processed after being sorted from smallest 
to largest. The standard for processing is below the lower limit and beyond the upper limit. Shrinkage replaces these 
values with their specific percentile values, while truncation directly deletes the values.

### Data transformation

#### Description

Data transformation refers to a process of manipulating or processing the data in the original dataset to extract or 
modify the information or features contained therein. In the fields of data analysis and machine learning, data 
transformation is an important step in data preprocessing, which can be used for tasks such as data dimensionality 
reduction, feature extraction, anomaly detection, and data smoothing.

### Dimension reduction

#### Description

Dimensionality reduction refers to the process of mapping data from a high-dimensional space to a low-dimensional space 
while preserving the essential features of the original dataset. In the field of data analysis and machine learning, 
high-dimensional datasets often lead to a significant increase in computational complexity and difficulty in visualizing
and interpreting the data. Therefore, dimensionality reduction can effectively reduce the dimensionality of the dataset,
improve data processing efficiency and interpretability, and also reduce the risk of overfitting and improve the 
generalization ability of machine learning models.

> [Dimensionality reduction - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction)

#### Parameters

- `method`: Dimensionality reduction method. Currently
  supports [PCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis)
  and [LDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_discriminant_analysis) two methods.
- `n_components`: Number of components to keep. Data types are numeric.

### Sample balancing

#### Description

Sample balance refers to the adjustment of sample sizes in each category of a dataset to achieve a more even distribution.
In machine learning and data analysis, sample balance is an important preprocessing step because imbalanced datasets can
lead to biased results and affect the performance and accuracy of models.

Sample balance can be achieved through various methods, such as undersampling, oversampling, and synthetic sampling. 
Undersampling involves randomly removing samples from the class with a larger sample size to achieve balance. 
Oversampling involves duplicating or synthesizing new samples for the class with a smaller sample size. Synthetic 
sampling involves using generative models such as SMOTEENN to generate new samples to increase sample size and balance 
different classes.

Sample balance can improve model performance and accuracy while reducing bias due to imbalanced samples. However, 
excessive sample balance may lead to overfitting, so it is necessary to adjust and balance based on specific situations.

> [Oversampling and undersampling in data analysis - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oversampling_and_undersampling_in_data_analysis)

#### Parameters

- `balancing_method`: Sample balancing method. Currently
  supports `undersample` ([RandomUnderSampler](https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/references/generated/imblearn.under_sampling.RandomUnderSampler.html)),
  `oversample` ([RandomOverSampler](https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/references/generated/imblearn.over_sampling.RandomOverSampler.html))
  and `combined` ï¼ˆ[SMOTEENN](https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/references/generated/imblearn.combine.SMOTEENN.html))
  three methods.

### Normalization

#### Description

Data standardization refers to the process of transforming raw data to conform to a certain standard or specification, 
making it easier to compare and analyze. The most common method of data standardization is to transform the data into a 
standard normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a variance of 1, or to scale the data within a certain range.

The main purpose of data standardization is to eliminate differences in units and scales among the data, making 
comparisons between different variables more fair. For example, if two variables have vastly different ranges of values,
the comparison between them may be subject to significant errors. Standardizing the data can eliminate such errors and 
make the data more reliable and interpretable.

Data standardization is a necessary step in many data analysis and machine learning tasks, such as clustering analysis, 
regression analysis, and neural networks. Common methods of data standardization include z-score normalization, min-max 
normalization, and mean-variance normalization.

> [Normalization (statistics) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_(statistics))

#### Parameters

- `Method`: Normalization method. Currently supports [Min_Max](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_scaling) and
  [Z_Score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score) two methods.
