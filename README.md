This continuous assessment component focuses on the end product of your work. Each team will present a demonstration of their completed software system. The demonstration is intended to show the application in action, so the team should prepare a demonstration that shows the various functions of their application. This could include (for a data centred system) showing how the database is maintained, and showing how some sample queries and reports can be performed. If multiple user views are supported, this should also be shown. The demonstration is also an opportunity to show any specially interesting or unusual features of the application at hand. Each team will also attend a Q&A review meeting with a member of the teaching team to discuss further details of their implemented system. In the following sections we provide further details about the two activities that are part of this continuous assessment component.

## Pre-recorded Video Presentation

Each team is invited to produce a 10 minute video that shows the software, product of their team effort, in use. The video should include:

- A short executive summary of the project, including a short description of the project aims, and the challenges involved.

- Features of the system. One could talk about data entry; data modification; queries and reports; different user views (choosing suitable use-cases and work through them)

- Some system internal features (to demonstrate the familiarity with the software)

- Any special features (as appropriate):  web access; graphical presentation of statistics; the working of interesting algorithms.

On the other hand it should be remembered:

- There is no need to show ***everything*** (updating one kind of record may be much like another; one query is often much like another; give the flavour, but don’t get boring)
- The video should last ***no more than*** ***10*** minutes, a full survey may not actually be possible!

Slides and/or screen recording can be used to produce this. As a consequence it is not necessary for the members of the team to be visible in the video. It is understood that, unless otherwise mentioned clearly in the video, ALL people in the team have contributed to it.

The video is to be uploaded to [https://stream.liv.ac.uk/](https://stream.liv.ac.uk/) as explained in the file [comp208_vstream_guide.png](https://canvas.liverpool.ac.uk/courses/59720/files/8339481?wrap=1 "Link").

A part from submitting a video as described above, each team is required to provide additional documentation as described [here](https://canvas.liverpool.ac.uk/courses/59720/assignments/219445 "Demo Documentation").

## Discussion Session

During the period mentioned at the top of the page, there will be a Q&A meeting with a member of the teaching team (the *reviewer*) in which scope and limits of the implemented system will be assessed. All members of the team must attend this event. Absence will be penalized in the usual way.

This event could be run on-campus or using Zoom, Skype or Microsoft Teams, or any other on-line platform allowing video conferencing. The specific arrangements will be agreed with the reviewer.

### **Q&A sessions should be arranged soon after the term restarts after Easter!!**
